    <p>We teach and train in the traditional manner.  Respect and ettiqette are a main part of the classes.  The development of self-control and paying attention are only a couple of the things that are gained from martial arts training.  The classes are conducted in the following format:
    </p>

    <br />
     
       <ul>
            <li> Kihon-Basic Techniques   </li>
            <li> Kata-Forms or Self-Defense Training  </li>
            <li> Kumite-Sparring </li>
       </ul>
      
    <br />  
    <p>At the end of the Youth Classes,  the students participate in games to help build strength, speed and coordination. It is also a lot of fun. </p>
    <br />
    <p>The purpose of teaching Shotokan Karate to young people is to assist them in some of the following things: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Self-Control </li>
        <li> Self-Discipline </li>
        <li> Self-Defense </li>
        <li> Increase attention span </li>
        <li> Learn to follow directions </li>
        <li> Respect for themselves and others </li>  
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Learning karate as an adult tends to make us more relaxed and comfortable around others.
      It creates confidence and a quiet pride that shows through.  Connecting the mind and the 
      body is the easiest way there is to get rid of stress at the end of the day.
